# HALchemy
A CLI chatbot space survival game.

## Intro
You have been awakened from cryogenic sleep on a spaceship headed for Earth. The ship's semi-autonomous, intelligent computer system, HAL, needs your decision-making skills to guide the ship safely back to Earth before it's too late.

Your mission is to work with HAL to get back to Earth on time. HAL will interact with you, answer your questions, and follow your orders. You approach a nearby terminal. Follow the instructions below to boot up HAL and begin your mission!
